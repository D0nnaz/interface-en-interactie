I had had enough; I had to escape. I went with a 36-year-old man I had met online. He had no fixed abode and
moved from
friend to friend. Things were going well until we arrived at friends who were also friends with my mother.
But when my
mother found me, my laptop was immediately smashed with a hammer. Then I was chained to the bed. Dee Dee
hung bells on
every door so I could hear exactly where I was going. I was beaten with a clothes hanger and called all
sorts of
names. Moreover, I was barely fed, and this went on for two weeks.
			
I secretly bought a phone and was able to stay in contact with my boyfriend, Nick, whom I had been talking
to online for
two years. We arranged to meet for the first time at the cinema, hoping Dee Dee would react well, but the
opposite
happened. She called him a pervert and asked him to leave me alone.
			
Later, I asked Nick if he would do anything for me, and he said yes. Then I asked him if he would kill my
mother, and he
agreed. I had prepared rubber gloves for Nick outside, which he would have to put on. Inside, I would hand
him the
knife. I asked him to be quiet because the door creaked and my mother was asleep. I warned him, 'Please be
as quiet as
possible, or my mother will wake up.'
			
Once inside, I handed him the knife, then locked myself in the bathroom. I turned on the water and covered
my ears, but
I could still hear everything that happened. The sound of my mother screaming was truly terrifying. I waited
there until
the screams stopped. Dee Dee was murdered with 17 stab wounds.
			
I was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and Nick got life. I have just been released and now have a
tumultuous love life.
In prison, I received 250 love letters.</p>
