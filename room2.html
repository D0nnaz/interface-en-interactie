In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated our apartment and all our belongings, including all medical records.
With no medical records available, Dee Dee had free rein. Fortunately, we received a free house and car as
aid. Additionally, a GoFundMe page was set up, resulting in substantial financial support. The excessive
medication led to deterioration of my teeth, requiring further medical treatment. As a result, I lost some
strictly forbidden. I wasn't allowed online at all without my mother's supervision, let alone having my own
Facebook page. It was anything but intentional. My Facebook page had a false name, so it was truly a secret
account under the name Emma Rose. This allowed me to communicate with my boyfriend, Nick. When I turned 19,
I discovered a medical ID card with a strange birthdate on it: 1991, while my mother always claimed I was
born in 1995. This began to raise doubts about the truth of the things my mother had told me.</p>
