My mother, Dee Dee, claimed that I, Gypsy, suffered from sleep apnea and thus needed a ventilator. That's
how it all began. But it escalated further as she then claimed I suffered from epileptic seizures, requiring
a plethora of medications.
According to my mother, my mental development halted due to the progressing severity of my medical
conditions, while the symptoms continued to pile up. Additionally, it was 'discovered' that I had hearing
impairment, leading to a procedure for ear tubes insertion. At one point, they even claimed I was incapable
of eating, resulting in the administration of tube feeding.

Following an accident involving my grandfather's motorcycle, where I only sustained a minor scrape on my
knee, Dee Dee rushed me to the hospital. Despite the minor injury, she insisted on getting a wheelchair for
me, saying, 'You're in a
wheelchair now, and you'll stay in it.' The list of purported ailments kept growing:

- Asthma
- Epilepsy
- Hearing impairment
- Visual impairment
- Paralysis
- Intellectual disability (mentally not older than 4 years)
- Chromosomal abnormality
- Leukemia, and so on...

Then Dee Dee said to me, 'Your hair will soon start falling out. Maybe it's a good idea to shave it off
before it falls
out, as it will be less painful. I'll do it with you, in solidarity.' So, my mother shaved my hair, and of
course, DeeDee was praised for her support.</p>
